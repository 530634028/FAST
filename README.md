FAST (Framework for Heterogeneous Medical Image Computing) is an open-source cross-platform framework with the main goal of making it easier to do processing and visualization of medical images on heterogeneous systems (CPU+GPU).

A detailed description of the framework design can be found [here](https://github.com/smistad/FAST/wiki/Framework-Design).

To setup and build the framework, see the instructions for your operating system:
* [Linux (Ubuntu)](https://github.com/smistad/FAST/wiki/Linux-instructions)
* [Windows](https://github.com/smistad/FAST/wiki/Windows-instructions)
* [Mac OS X](https://github.com/smistad/FAST/wiki/Mac-OS-X-instructions)
